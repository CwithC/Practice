                <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
                <p><strong>Taylor Alison Swift</strong> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography">discography</a> spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and widespread media coverage.<br> Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music">country music</a>. She signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, before releasing her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.</p>
                <p>Swift explored <u>country pop</u> on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of the singles <q>Love Story</q> and <q>You Belong with Me</q> on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. She experimented with rock and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by the singles <q><i>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</i></q> and <q><i>I Knew You Were Trouble</i></q>. Swift eschewed country on her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping tracks <q>Shake It Off</q>, <q>Blank Space</q>, and <q>Bad Blood</q>. The media scrutiny on Swift's life inspired Reputation (2017), which drew from urban sounds. Led by <q>Look What You Made Me Do</q>, <strong><u>the album made Swift the only act in MRC Data history to have four albums each sell over a million copies in a week.</u></strong></p>
